# React Native Redux Saga Project

Welcome to the React Native Redux Saga Project! This repository contains a React Native application designed to provide a hands-on experience in understanding the Redux Saga library within the context of a React Native app.

## Key Features:

**Task Creation:** Users can add new tasks by specifying a title and description. Adding a new task triggers an asynchronous action managed by Redux Saga. :white_check_mark:

**Task Modification:** Users can modify details of existing tasks, such as the title or description. This operation is also handled through an asynchronous action with Redux Saga.

**Task Deletion:** Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed. This operation is also managed through Redux Saga. :white_check_mark:

**Task Viewing:** A list of tasks will be displayed within the app, allowing users to clearly see the tasks they need to complete. :white_check_mark:

**State Management with Redux:** Utilize Redux to manage the application's state, including the state of tasks. :white_check_mark:

**Asynchronous Operations with Redux Saga:** Harness the power of Redux Saga to manage asynchronous operations such as adding, modifying, and deleting tasks. This will help you understand how Redux Saga simplifies handling asynchronous workflows within a React Native app.

**Styling:** Create an attractive and intuitive user interface using a styling library like styled-components or react-native-styles.

**Navigation:** Employ React Navigation to craft a seamless navigation experience across various screens of the app, such as the task list screen and task detail screen.

**Data Persistence:** Utilize AsyncStorage or redux-persist to ensure that task data is retained even after the app is closed.

**Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and react-native-testing-library to ensure that different parts of the app function correctly.
